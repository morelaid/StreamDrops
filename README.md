StreamingDrops is a Minecraft plugin developed for Java Server. StreamingDrops provides a Twitch integration to allow your viewers to get special drops from a live stream. The focus is on the "Twitch Gaming Drops" feature enabled by Twitch, which is already enabled for many games on the platform. Unfortunately, for technical reasons, there can be no direct integration of Minecraft on Twitch, so StreamingDrops closes exactly this technical hurdle.

In doing so, StreamingDrops will not be integrated into Twitch, but will enable the possibility of drops and also the verification of drops on the Minecraft server. This means that StreamingDrops can reward the viewers of a Twitch stream and provide unique drops. 
Moreover, streamers are rewarded with new viewers and an ever-growing community. Along the way, the streamer advertises the server they are playing on, bringing new players to the server.
